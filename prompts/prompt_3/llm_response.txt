Below are the **most relevant areas of graph theory and graph labeling** that directly connect to your problem:

> **Problem:** *If (G) is nongraceful, is its line graph (L(G)) graceful?*
> (Equivalent: What are the graphs for which *both* (G) and (L(G)) are nongraceful?)

Each area below plays a structural or conceptual role in understanding this.

# **1. Graceful Labeling Theory (ℤ₊–valuations)**

### **Relationship**

Gracefulness is the central topic: your problem asks about the interaction of gracefulness between a graph and its line graph.
Both PDFs emphasize definitions, characterizations, known graceful families, and obstructions.

### **Relevant Concepts/Tools**

* Graceful labeling definition and injective vertex-labeling constraints.
* Edge-difference sets ({1,2,\dots,q}).
* **Known graceful families**: paths, stars, caterpillars, many trees, wheels, certain unicyclic graphs.
* **Non-gracefulness criteria**, e.g.,

  * Eulerian + (|E| \equiv 1,2 \pmod 4) ⇒ nongraceful.
  * Cycles (C_n) are graceful iff (n\equiv0,3 \pmod 4).
* **m–gracefulness** and near-gracefulness measures (from Gallian).
* **Constructive labeling techniques**: shifting, reflective labelings, alternating sequences.

These tools help determine whether (G) or (L(G)) is graceful.

# **2. Study of Line Graphs and Transformations of Graph Invariants**

### **Relationship**

Your question specifically compares (G) and (L(G)), so understanding line graphs structurally is essential.

### **Relevant Concepts/Tools**

* **Definition:** vertices of (L(G)) represent edges of (G); adjacency ↔ shared endpoint.
* **Degree transformation:**
  [
  d_{L(G)}(uv) = d_G(u) + d_G(v) - 2.
  ]
* **Edge count transformation:**
  [
  |E(L(G))| = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{v} d(v)^2 - |E(G)|.
  ]
* **Special cases:**

  * (L(P_n) = P_{n-1})
  * (L(C_n) = C_n)
  * (L(K_{1,n}) = K_n)
* **Claw-free nature of line graphs**, which can simplify or constrain labelings.
* **Iterated line graphs** (L^k(G)) and their structural patterns.

Understanding how degrees and connectivity patterns evolve helps predict when (L(G)) might inherit graceful or nongraceful properties.

# **3. Unicyclic Graph Theory (Graphs with One Cycle)**

### **Relationship**

Many examples, counterexamples, and constructive results in your PDFs involve **unicyclic graphs** (cycle + trees).
Cycles give trivial counterexamples to the global conjecture.
Other unicyclic families (hairy cycles, sun graphs) are essential testbeds.

### **Relevant Concepts/Tools**

* Characterization of cycles as graceful/non-graceful.
* Structures like:

  * **Hairy cycles** and **sun graphs**
  * **(C_n \oplus (P_t;P_s;P_1;...))** attachments
* Known results:

  * Almost all unicyclic graphs except some cycles are graceful (Truszczyński's conjecture).
  * Specific families where (L(G)) is non-graceful due to parity.
* Leaf-attachment techniques for constructing graceful labelings.

Unicyclic graphs are ideal for isolating non-gracefulness that does not arise from simple cycle parity.

# **4. Tree Labeling Theory (Graceful Trees Conjecture)**

### **Relationship**

Trees are the largest class where gracefulness is heavily studied; if a nongraceful tree were ever found, your question reduces to:
“Would its line graph necessarily be graceful?”

Also, line graphs of trees produce interesting non-tree structures (often cactus graphs).

### **Relevant Concepts/Tools**

* **Graceful tree conjecture** (open).
* Structured graceful families:

  * Caterpillars, spiders, lobsters, banana trees.
* Vertex-relabelling strategies using:

  * Bipartite ordering,
  * Path decomposition,
  * Star-centered constructions.

Trees and their line graphs provide a controlled environment for structural analysis.

# **5. Degree Sequence and Parity-Based Graph Labeling Obstructions**

### **Relationship**

Much non-gracefulness in your PDFs relies on **parity-based arguments**, especially for Eulerian line graphs or graphs with certain edge counts.

### **Relevant Concepts/Tools**

* Eulerian graphs: all degrees even.
* Critical obstruction:
  **Eulerian + (|E| \equiv 1,2\pmod 4)** ⇒ nongraceful.
* Using the degree-sum formula to force parity in (L(G)):
  [
  |E(L(G))| \mod 4
  \quad\text{from}\quad
  \sum d(v)^2.
  ]
* Degree constraints for line-graph regularity.

This gives a purely arithmetic tool for proving that (L(G)) is nongraceful or “must” be graceful.

---

# **6. Bigraceful Graphs (graphs where both (G) and (L(G)) are graceful)**

### **Relationship**

Your conjecture is essentially about whether **both can be nongraceful**.
The opposite scenario—**both graceful**—is exactly the study of bigraceful graphs.

### **Relevant Concepts/Tools**

* Families known to be bigraceful:

  * Certain Cartesian products,
  * Some unicyclic constructions,
  * Join-like operations in Gnanajothi’s thesis.
* Methods for proving bigracefulness:

  * Explicit vertex-difference constructions,
  * Symmetry exploitation,
  * Inductive labeling templates.

These patterns help detect structural features shared by graphs whose line graphs maintain labelability.

# **7. Structural Graph Theory: Claw-Free Graphs and Forbidden Substructures**

### **Relationship**

Every line graph is **claw-free**, and many graceful labeling techniques work well (or poorly) depending on the absence of claws or presence of small cycles.

### **Relevant Concepts/Tools**

* Characterizations of line graphs by forbidden induced subgraphs.
* Impact of claw-free structure on Eulerian parity conditions.
* Using structural decompositions (e.g., edge clique covers deriving from star neighborhoods).

Structural properties help to analyze how hard or easy it is to label (L(G)).

---

# **8. Cartesian Products and Graph Composition Techniques**

### **Relationship**

Your PDFs mention graceful labelings for graph products like:

* (P_m \times P_n),
* (K_{1,n} \times P_2).

These graphs often appear as line graphs or subgraphs of line graphs.

### **Relevant Concepts/Tools**

* Product labeling strategies:

  * Coordinate-based labeling,
  * Modular arithmetic labelings.
* Decomposition of line graphs into product-like blocks.

Understanding product techniques can support constructive approaches to graceful labelings for (L(G)).

---

# **9. Computational Graph Labeling & Algorithmic Search**

### **Relationship**

To explore the boundary of your conjecture (finding or excluding double-nongraceful graphs), computational methods are powerful for small graphs.

### **Relevant Concepts/Tools**

* Backtracking graceful-labeling algorithms.
* Incremental label testers.
* Exhaustive search on small graphs (up to 10–12 vertices).
* Pattern detection to hypothesize structural laws.

Computational insight often guides the theoretical direction in graph labeling research.
