1. **Restating the main problem**

The statement you’re looking at is:

> **Conjecture / Question.** If a graph (G) is *not* graceful, must its line graph (L(G)) be graceful?

Equivalently:

* “Are there graphs (G) for which *both* (G) and (L(G)) are nongraceful?”
* The conjecture would say **no** such graph exists.

**Important note:** For *all* finite simple graphs this statement is actually **false**.
If you take a cycle (C_n) with (n \equiv 1 \text{ or } 2 \pmod 4), then (C_n) is nongraceful, and its line graph is again (C_n) (the line graph of a cycle is the same cycle) which is also nongraceful.

So cycles already give counterexamples in the fully general form. That means your project is likely about:

* understanding this question more deeply for **restricted classes of graphs** (for example, beyond “obvious” counterexamples like some cycles), or
* characterizing when *both* (G) and (L(G)) can fail to be graceful.

I’ll keep that in mind as I describe the landscape.

2. **Key definitions and properties involved**

Here are the main notions that show up in your PDFs and are central to your problem.

### Basic graph notions

* We work with finite simple graphs (G = (V,E)), with (|V| = n) vertices and (|E| = q) edges.

* **Unicyclic graph**: a connected graph with exactly one cycle.

* **Eulerian graph**: a connected graph in which every vertex has even degree.

### Graceful labeling and graceful graphs

Let (G=(V,E)) have (q) edges.

* A **graceful labeling** of (G) is an injective map
  [
  f: V(G) \to {0,1,2,\dots,q}
  ]
  such that for each edge (xy\in E), the induced edge label (|f(x)-f(y)|) is distinct, and the set of edge labels is exactly ({1,2,\dots,q}).

* A graph is **graceful** if it admits at least one graceful labeling.

Some standard facts gathered in *On Graceful Line Graphs* and Gallian’s survey:

* **Paths:** every path (P_n) is graceful.

* **Cycles:** a cycle (C_n) is graceful **iff** (n \equiv 0) or (3 \pmod 4).

* **Complete graphs:** (K_n) is graceful iff (n\le3).

* **Complete bipartite graphs:** Every (K_{m,n}) is graceful.

* **Wheels:** (W_n = C_{n-1} + K_1) are graceful.

* A useful necessary condition: if (G) is graceful, then
  [
  n \le q+1.
  ]

* A classic non-gracefulness test: if (G) is an **Eulerian** graph with (q) edges and
  [
  q \equiv 1 \text{ or } 2 \pmod 4,
  ]
  then (G) is **not graceful**.

From Gallian’s survey you also have notions like **m-gracefulness**, which measure “how close” a nongraceful graph is to graceful, and show that there are infinitely many nongraceful graphs with very high “almost graceful” behavior.

### Line graph (L(G))

* The **line graph** (L(G)) has one vertex for each edge of (G). Two vertices in (L(G)) are adjacent if and only if the corresponding edges in (G) share a common endpoint.

Key properties (Theorem 2.4 in *On Graceful Line Graphs*):

* If (G) has (p) vertices and (q) edges, then:

  * (L(G)) has (q) vertices.
  * The degree of a vertex (corresponding to edge (uv)) in (L(G)) is
    [
    d_{L(G)}(uv) = d_G(u) + d_G(v) - 2.
    ]
  * The number of edges of (L(G)) is
    [
    |E(L(G))| = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^p d_i^2 - q,
    ]
    where (d_1,\dots,d_p) are the degrees in (G).

Special cases:

* (L(P_n) = P_{n-1}).
* (L(C_n) = C_n).
* (L(K_{1,n}) = K_n).

These already give many explicit pairs ((G,L(G))).

### “Bigraceful” graphs

* A graph (G) is **bigraceful** if **both (G) and (L(G)) are graceful**. This term appears in Gnanajothi’s thesis and Murugan’s later work.

Examples of graphs where both (G) and (L(G)) are known to be graceful include:

* (K_n) for (n\le3).
* Many product graphs like (P_m\times P_n), certain (K_{1,n}\times P_2), etc.
* Various unicyclic constructions such as (C_4\oplus (P_n;P_n;P_1;P_1)) and their line graphs.

### Specific families used as testbeds

From *On Graceful Line Graphs* and Gallian’s survey we get several structured families, which are natural test cases:

* **Sun graphs** (Sun(n,k)): unicyclic graphs formed by attaching (k) pendant edges to each vertex of a cycle (C_n); these are “hairy cycles,” and they are graceful for all (k\ge 1).
  The paper shows that for certain (n,k) with (k) odd, the line graph (L(Sun(n,k))) is *not* graceful, using parity arguments and the Eulerian criterion above.

* **Unicyclic graphs of the form** (C_n \oplus (P_t; P_s; P_1;\dots;P_1)): a cycle with two paths attached at adjacent vertices and possibly more pendant edges at other vertices. These graphs and their line graphs are shown graceful for specific ranges of parameters (e.g. (n=9,11,13), (t\ge s>n), (t) odd, plus some arithmetic condition).

* More broadly, Gallian’s survey lists many graceful unicyclic graphs and highlights Truszczyński’s conjecture that all unicyclic graphs except cycles (C_n) with (n\equiv1,2\pmod4) are graceful.

3. **Why this problem is challenging/interesting**

Even ignoring the trivial cycle counterexamples, your question sits at the intersection of two hard themes:

1. **Gracefulness itself is hard.**

   * The “graceful tree conjecture” (all trees are graceful) is a central open problem.
   * For unicyclic graphs, it’s conjectured that all except certain cycles are graceful, and proving this has been very difficult.

   So any statement that quantifies over *all nongraceful graphs* is bumping directly into the frontier of what’s known.

2. **The line graph operation does not behave nicely with respect to gracefulness.**
   The papers you gave show that:

   * Some graphs and their line graphs are both graceful (bigraceful families).
   * Some graphs are graceful but their line graphs are not (e.g., certain sun graphs, some wheels (W_n) where (L(W_n)) fails the parity condition).

   So “graceful” is neither preserved nor reflected by the line graph operation in any simple way.

3. **Your conjecture is extremely strong once you phrase it as an avoidance of “double failure”.**
   Saying “if (G) is not graceful then (L(G)) is graceful” is equivalent to:

   > There is **no** graph for which *both* (G) and (L(G)) fail to be graceful.

   But we already see that many reasonable parity arguments that make (G) nongraceful (e.g., Eulerian with bad edge-parity) can also show (L(G)) nongraceful, because (L(G)) often inherits Eulerian structure and non-friendly edge counts.

   The paper *On Graceful Line Graphs* exploits exactly these ideas to show non-gracefulness of certain (L(G)); turning that around to prove that such an (L(G)) **must** be graceful whenever (G) is not would contradict many of these constructions.

4. **The structure of (L(G)) can be dramatically more complicated than (G).**
   For example, a tree (which is acyclic) can have a line graph with many cycles. For general graphs, even computing the degree sequence transformation ({d_i}\mapsto L(G)) and then applying parity conditions becomes messy.

   So even if you focus on a “simple” class like trees or unicyclic graphs, their line graphs can become heavily interconnected, and current graceful-labeling techniques are quite delicate and case-heavy.

All that makes the “no graph is bad in both stages” type of statement feel very ambitious, and understanding where it breaks (and which restricted versions might be true) is mathematically interesting.

---

4. **Natural simplifications and special cases to start with**

Given that the general statement is false (cycles are immediate counterexamples), good next steps are to **tighten** or **localize** the question:

#### (a) Degree-≤2 graphs: disjoint unions of paths and cycles

* Any graph where every vertex has degree at most 2 is a disjoint union of paths and cycles.
* We know:

  * which paths are graceful (all),
  * which cycles are graceful ((n\equiv0,3\pmod4)), and
  * that (L(G)) is another such union (since (L(P_n) = P_{n-1}) and (L(C_n)=C_n)).

This class is completely analyzable and already shows exactly where the naive conjecture fails (nongraceful cycles). You can try to re-formulate your question here along the lines of:

> For disjoint unions of paths and cycles, classify all graphs where both (G) and (L(G)) are nongraceful.

That’s a clean and fully attackable subproblem.

#### (b) Trees (if nongraceful trees exist)

If one day a nongraceful tree (T) is found, then the refined question

> “Is (L(T)) necessarily graceful?”

would be very natural. Right now this is a bit hypothetical because no such tree is known, but structurally:

* (L(T)) is a connected claw-free graph with maximum degree at most (\Delta(T)-1).
* Many families of such graphs are known to be graceful (various grid-type graphs, spiders, caterpillars, etc.).

So “nongraceful tree ⇒ graceful line graph” is a nice, more targeted version compatible with the graceful tree conjecture.

#### (c) Unicyclic graphs beyond pure cycles

Because Truszczyński’s conjecture essentially says that **the only** nongraceful unicyclic graphs should be those “bad” cycles, you can ask:

> Suppose (G) is unicyclic and nongraceful **for some other reason** (if any exist). Must (L(G)) be graceful?

The paper *On Graceful Line Graphs* already studies classes like sun graphs and (C_n \oplus (P_t; P_s; P_1;\dots;P_1)) and shows various combinations of “(G) graceful / nongraceful” and “(L(G)) graceful / nongraceful”.

Systematically mapping:

* when (G) is graceful and (L(G)) is not,
* when both are graceful (bigraceful),
* when both are not (if any construction exists beyond cycles),

would be a concrete research program inside the unicyclic world.

#### (d) Graphs whose line graphs are forced non-graceful by parity

Using the Eulerian + parity obstruction for graceful labelings:

* If (L(G)) is Eulerian, and (|E(L(G))|\equiv1,2\pmod4), then (L(G)) is automatically nongraceful.
* Using the degree formula (|E(L(G))| = \frac12\sum d_i^2 - q), you can characterize degree sequences of (G) that force this.

This gives a **systematic way to search for counterexamples** (graphs where both (G) and (L(G)) fail) or to characterize classes where such a double failure cannot occur. That’s a very natural structural simplification of the big question.

---

If you’d like, next step we can do is:

* pick one of these restricted settings (say, unicyclic graphs without the “bad” cycles, or some small max-degree family),
* carefully work through whether “(G) nongraceful ⇒ (L(G)) graceful” could plausibly hold there, and
* either construct explicit counterexamples or prove partial positive results.
