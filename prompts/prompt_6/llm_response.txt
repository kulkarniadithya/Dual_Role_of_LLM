We show that the implication

[
(\forall G);[G \text{ nongraceful } \Rightarrow L(G)\ \text{ graceful}]
]

is **false**, by giving a rigorous counterexample.

Throughout, all graphs are finite, simple, and undirected.

## 1. Definitions

### Definition 1.1 (Graceful labeling and graceful graph)

Let (G=(V,E)) be a graph with (|E| = q).
A **graceful labeling** of (G) is an injective function
[
f : V(G) \to {0,1,\dots,q}
]
such that the induced edge labels
[
{|f(u) - f(v)| : uv \in E(G)}
]
are pairwise distinct and equal to the entire set ({1,2,\dots,q}).

If (G) admits a graceful labeling, we say that (G) is **graceful**.
If (G) does not admit a graceful labeling, we say that (G) is **nongraceful**.

---

### Definition 1.2 (Line graph)

Given a graph (G=(V,E)), its **line graph** (L(G)) is the graph defined as follows:

* The vertex set of (L(G)) is the edge set of (G):
  [
  V(L(G)) = E(G).
  ]
* Two vertices (e_1, e_2 \in V(L(G))) (that is, two edges of (G)) are adjacent in (L(G)) if and only if the corresponding edges of (G) are incident in (G) (i.e., share a common endpoint).

---

### Definition 1.3 (Cycle)

For an integer (n \geq 3), a **cycle** (C_n) is a graph on vertices ({v_0,\dots,v_{n-1}}) with edges
[
v_0v_1,\ v_1v_2,\ \dots,\ v_{n-2}v_{n-1},\ v_{n-1}v_0.
]

---

## 2. Structural lemma: the line graph of a cycle

We first identify the line graph of a cycle.

### Lemma 2.1

For every integer (n \ge 3), the line graph of the cycle (C_n) is isomorphic to (C_n) itself, i.e.,
[
L(C_n) \cong C_n.
]

#### Proof

Let (C_n) have vertex set ({v_0,\dots,v_{n-1}}) and edge set
[
E(C_n) = {e_i = v_i v_{i+1} : i = 0,1,\dots,n-1},
]
where indices are taken modulo (n). Thus
(e_0 = v_0v_1, e_1 = v_1v_2, \dots, e_{n-1} = v_{n-1}v_0).

Then in the line graph (L(C_n)), the vertex corresponding to (e_i) is adjacent to the vertex corresponding to (e_j) if and only if (e_i) and (e_j) share a common endpoint in (C_n).

Observe that in (C_n):

* Edge (e_i = v_i v_{i+1}) shares a vertex with:

  * (e_{i-1} = v_{i-1}v_i) (common endpoint (v_i)), and
  * (e_{i+1} = v_{i+1}v_{i+2}) (common endpoint (v_{i+1})),
* and **no other** edges share a vertex with (e_i).

Therefore, in (L(C_n)), the vertex corresponding to (e_i) is adjacent **exactly** to the vertices corresponding to (e_{i-1}) and (e_{i+1}) (indices modulo (n)). Each of the (n) vertices has degree 2, and the adjacency pattern is exactly that of an (n)-cycle.

Define a map
[
\varphi : V(L(C_n)) \to V(C_n), \quad \varphi(e_i) = v_i.
]
Under this map, edges (e_i e_{i+1}) in (L(C_n)) correspond to edges (v_iv_{i+1}) in (C_n), so (\varphi) is a graph isomorphism. Hence (L(C_n) \cong C_n).
(\square)

## 3. A known result: characterization of graceful cycles

We now use a classical theorem about cycles. We state it as a lemma; the result is standard in the literature (often attributed to A. Rosa).

### Lemma 3.1 (Gracefulness of cycles)

Let (n \ge 3). The cycle (C_n) is graceful **if and only if**
[
n \equiv 0 \pmod{4}
\quad \text{or} \quad
n \equiv 3 \pmod{4}.
]

In particular, if (n \equiv 1 \pmod{4}) or (n \equiv 2 \pmod{4}), then (C_n) is **nongraceful**.

#### Remark on proof

This is a well-established theorem in graph labeling theory; standard proofs can be found in survey and monograph literature on graceful labelings. In a journal article, one would typically **cite** this result rather than reprove it, as the proof is nontrivial and not directly related to the new contribution (which is the analysis of the conjecture involving line graphs).

We therefore take Lemma 3.1 as given.

(\square)

---

## 4. Disproof of the conjecture

We can now show that the implication

[
G \textrm{ nongraceful } \Rightarrow L(G) \textrm{ graceful}
]

fails in general.

### Theorem 4.1

There exists a graph (G) such that (G) is nongraceful and (L(G)) is also nongraceful. Consequently, the implication

[
(\forall G);[G \textrm{ nongraceful } \Rightarrow L(G) \textrm{ graceful}]
]

is false.

#### Proof

Let (n) be any integer with (n \ge 3) and
[
n \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \quad \text{or} \quad n \equiv 2 \pmod{4}.
]

Consider the cycle (G = C_n).

1. **(G) is nongraceful.**
   By Lemma 3.1, cycles (C_n) are graceful if and only if (n \equiv 0,3 \pmod{4}).
   Since we have chosen (n\equiv 1) or (2\pmod{4}), it follows that (C_n) is **not** graceful. That is, (G) is nongraceful.

2. **Compute the line graph of (G).**
   By Lemma 2.1, we have
   [
   L(C_n) \cong C_n.
   ]
   Hence
   [
   L(G) \cong C_n.
   ]

3. **(L(G)) is also nongraceful.**
   Since (L(G)) is isomorphic to (C_n), and (C_n) is nongraceful for this congruence class of (n), it follows again by Lemma 3.1 that (L(G)) is nongraceful.

We have therefore exhibited a graph (G = C_n) (with (n\equiv1,2\pmod4)) such that:

* (G) is nongraceful, and
* (L(G)) is nongraceful.

This shows that there exists at least one counterexample to the universal implication
[
G \text{ nongraceful } \Rightarrow L(G) \text{ graceful}.
]

Consequently, the conjecture (in this global form, over all graphs) is **false**.
(\square)

## 5. Discussion and possible restricted versions

The above theorem **completely settles** the original implication in the negative: in full generality (over all finite simple graphs), it does not hold.

However, the method of proof also suggests natural **restricted variants** that remain open and may be interesting:

1. **Excluding cycles:**
   Is it true that for any connected graph (G) **not isomorphic** to a cycle (C_n) with (n\equiv1,2\pmod4),
   [
   G \textrm{ nongraceful } \Rightarrow L(G) \textrm{ graceful} ;?
   ]

2. **Specific classes (trees, certain unicyclic graphs, bounded-degree graphs):**
   One may ask the same implication restricted to a particular class of graphs where graceful labelings are better understood.

If you’d like, we can next try to formulate and explore such **refined conjectures** and attempt rigorous partial results in those narrower settings.
