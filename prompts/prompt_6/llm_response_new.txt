I’ll treat this as a serious “journal-style” attempt, but I need to be upfront: the conjecture is open, so **the proof below will necessarily hit a gap**. I’ll keep everything rigorously stated up to that point and clearly mark where an unproved step appears.

## 1. Statement of the conjecture

Let (G) be a finite simple graph. Its line graph (L(G)) is defined by
[
V(L(G)) = E(G), \quad
{e,f} \in E(L(G)) \iff e,f \in E(G) \text{ share an endpoint in } G.
]

A **graceful labeling** of a graph (H) with (q(H)) edges is an injective map
[
\ell : V(H) \to {0,1,\dots,q(H)}
]
such that the induced edge labels
[
\ell^*(xy) = |\ell(x)-\ell(y)|
]
are all distinct and equal to ({1,2,\dots,q(H)}).

The conjecture is:

> **Conjecture (Main).**
> If the line graph (L(G)) of a graph (G) is graceful, then (G) itself is graceful.

We attempt to prove this.

---

## 2. Preliminaries

Let (G) be a connected graph with
[
V(G) = {v_1,\dots,v_p}, \quad E(G) = {e_1,\dots,e_q}.
]
Then
[
V(L(G)) = E(G) = {e_1,\dots,e_q}.
]

We denote
[
q_L := |E(L(G))|.
]

Assume:

* (L(G)) is graceful.
* Fix a graceful labeling
  [
  f : V(L(G)) = E(G) \to {0,1,\dots,q_L}.
  ]

Thus:

* (f) is injective on edges of (G).
* For each edge (e_i e_j \in E(L(G))), i.e., for each pair of adjacent edges (e_i,e_j) in (G), we have an induced label
  [
  |f(e_i) - f(e_j)| \in {1,2,\dots,q_L},
  ]
  and every integer (1,\dots,q_L) occurs exactly once.

We want to construct a graceful labeling
[
g : V(G) \to {0,1,\dots,q},
]
injective, such that (|g(u)-g(v)|) over (uv\in E(G)) yields ({1,2,\dots,q}).

The main difficulty is that:

* The vertex labels of (L(G)) ((f)) live on **edges of (G)**.
* The **edge labels of (L(G))** (differences of (f)-values) live on **pairs of incident edges of (G)**.
* For (G) we want a vertex labeling (g) whose differences live on **edges of (G)**.

So information must be “pulled back” through two layers of structure.

---

## 3. Local structure around a vertex of (G)

For each vertex (v \in V(G)), let
[
E(v) = { e_{v,1}, e_{v,2}, \dots, e_{v,d(v)} }
]
be the set of edges incident with (v).

In (L(G)), this set corresponds to a clique (K_{d(v)}): every pair of distinct edges in (E(v)) shares the vertex (v) and so are adjacent.

Thus the subgraph induced by (E(v)) in (L(G)) is a complete graph (K_{d(v)}). The restriction
[
f_v := f|*{E(v)} : E(v) \to {0,1,\dots,q_L}
]
is injective, and the induced edge labels on this clique are all absolute differences
[
|f(e*{v,i}) - f(e_{v,j})| \quad (1\le i<j\le d(v)).
]

**Key observation.**
A graceful labeling of (L(G)) gives a family of labeled cliques (K_{d(v)}), one for each vertex (v) of (G), all glued together along shared vertices (the edges of (G)).

Intuitively, we’d like each such clique to “encode” a local **vertex label** (g(v)) of (G) as some function of the labels (f(e_{v,i})). The main technical challenge is to find a coherent choice of these local functions across the whole graph.

---

## 4. Attempt: Constructing a vertex labeling via edge-label potentials

### 4.1. Encoding differences along edges of (G)

We aim to define (g : V(G) \to \mathbb{Z}) such that for each edge (uv \in E(G)) we have
[
|g(u) - g(v)| \in {1,2,\dots,q}
]
and these differences are pairwise distinct.

A priori we do **not** insist yet that (|g(u)-g(v)| = f(e)) for some explicit function; that approach is too rigid because (f(e)) ranges up to (q_L) while we only have differences up to (q). Instead, we try this indirect approach:

* Choose an ordering of the edges ((e_1,\dots,e_q)).
* For each edge (e_k = u_k v_k), we will associate a sign (\sigma_k \in {-1,+1}) and a “target difference” (d_k \in {1,\dots,q}) such that ({d_1,\dots,d_q} = {1,\dots,q}).
* We then seek vertex labels (g) satisfying
  [
  g(v_k) - g(u_k) = \sigma_k d_k \quad \text{for all } k=1,\dots,q.
  ]

If such (g) exists and is injective, then (|g(u_k)-g(v_k)| = d_k) gives a graceful labeling of (G).

The **choice of the multiset ({d_k})** and signs (\sigma_k) must be made using the given graceful labeling (f) of (L(G)), in such a way that:

* The resulting system of linear difference equations is **consistent** around every cycle of (G).
* The induced vertex labels are injective.

We now formalize this.

### 4.2. Linear system associated to a labeling pattern

Fix a spanning tree (T) of (G). Let the edges of (G) be partitioned into:

* Tree edges (E(T)).
* Cotree edges (chords) (E(G)\setminus E(T)).

Denote (g(v_0)=0) for some root vertex (v_0). For each tree edge (e_k=u_kv_k), define
[
g(v_k) = g(u_k) + \sigma_k d_k
]
along the unique tree path from (v_0). This determines (g) uniquely on the vertices of (G) once all (\sigma_k) and (d_k) for tree edges are fixed.

For a cotree edge (e_k = uv), we then obtain **cycle constraints**:
[
g(v) - g(u) = \sigma_k d_k,
]
but the left-hand side is already determined by the tree labels. Equivalently, for each fundamental cycle (C) of (G) (tree edges plus one cotree edge), we require
[
\sum_{e_k \in C} \sigma_k d_k = 0,
]
where the sum is taken with appropriate orientation.

Thus we arrive at:

> **Problem A (cycle-consistency labeling problem).**
> Given a connected graph (G) and a family of positive integers ((d_k)*{k=1}^q) and signs ((\sigma_k)*{k=1}^q), can we choose them such that:
>
> 1. ({d_1,\dots,d_q} = {1,2,\dots,q}) (distinct differences),
> 2. For every cycle (C) in (G), we have (\sum_{e_k \in C} \sigma_k d_k = 0).

If Problem A can be solved in such a way that the resulting vertex labels (g) are injective and can be shifted to ({0,\dots,q}), then (G) is graceful.

So we now ask: **how can we use the graceful labeling (f) of (L(G)) to define a “good” choice of ((d_k,\sigma_k))?**

---

## 5. Using the graceful labeling of (L(G))

Recall that:

* (V(L(G)) = {e_1,\dots,e_q}).
* (f(e_k)\in{0,\dots,q_L}) are distinct.
* Each edge of (L(G)) corresponds to a pair of adjacent edges of (G).

### 5.1. A natural candidate: order edges of (G) by (f)

One naïve but natural idea is:

* Sort the edges of (G) by their (f)-labels:
  [
  f(e_{\pi(1)}) < f(e_{\pi(2)}) < \dots < f(e_{\pi(q)}),
  ]
  for some permutation (\pi) of ({1,\dots,q}).
* Define
  [
  d_{\pi(k)} := k, \quad k=1,\dots,q.
  ]
  That is, the smallest (f)-label gets difference (1), the next gets difference (2), and so on.

Now we attempt to choose the signs (\sigma_k \in {-1,+1}) in a way that makes the cycle constraints hold. Because (f) encodes detailed adjacency information via the **edge labels of (L(G))** (the absolute differences (|f(e_i)-f(e_j)|)), we hope to exploit these to guide the choice of the (\sigma_k).

At this point, the heart of the argument would be a lemma asserting that this is always possible.

---

## 6. A key (conjectural) cycle-consistency lemma

We now formulate the central lemma that, if true, would essentially complete the proof.

> **Lemma 6.1 (Cycle Consistency Lemma – desired).**
> Let (G) be a connected graph, let (L(G)) be graceful with labeling (f: E(G)\to{0,\dots,q_L}), and let ((d_k)) be defined by ordering the edges of (G) according to (f) as above. Then there exist choices of signs (\sigma_k\in{-1,+1}) such that for every cycle (C\subseteq G),
> [
> \sum_{e_k \in C} \sigma_k d_k = 0.
> ]

If Lemma 6.1 holds, we can proceed as follows.

### 6.1. Conditional completion of the argument

Assume Lemma 6.1. Fix a spanning tree (T). By the usual argument with potentials on a tree, we may define (g:V(G)\to\mathbb{Z}) uniquely up to an additive constant by:

* Choose a root vertex (v_0) and set (g(v_0)=0).
* For each tree edge (e_k = uv) oriented away from (v_0), set
  [
  g(v) = g(u) + \sigma_k d_k.
  ]

By construction, (g) is well-defined on (T). For a cotree edge (e_k=uv), the value of (g(v)-g(u)) along the unique path in (T) between (u) and (v) equals (\sum_{e_j \in C} \sigma_j d_j) over the fundamental cycle (C) determined by (e_k). Lemma 6.1 ensures that this sum is zero, hence
[
g(v) - g(u) = \sigma_k d_k
]
holds consistently for all edges (uv\in E(G)). Therefore:

* **All edge constraints** are simultaneously satisfied:
  [
  g(v_k)-g(u_k) = \sigma_k d_k, \quad k=1,\dots,q.
  ]
* Thus
  [
  |g(u_k) - g(v_k)| = d_k,
  ]
  and ({d_1,\dots,d_q} = {1,\dots,q}).

So (g) induces a graceful labeling of (G), *provided we can also ensure that (g) is injective and can be normalized to ({0,\dots,q})*. We address that next.

---

## 7. Injectivity of the vertex labeling

Under the above construction, (g) is defined by summing signed (d_k)-values along paths in the spanning tree. It is a priori possible that two distinct vertices (v,w\in V(G)) receive the same label.

We would therefore need a further lemma:

> **Lemma 7.1 (Injectivity lemma – desired).**
> With (g) constructed as above from a choice of ((d_k,\sigma_k)) satisfying Lemma 6.1, the map (g:V(G)\to\mathbb{Z}) is injective.

If Lemma 7.1 holds, then:

* The image (g(V(G))\subset \mathbb{Z}) has size (|V(G)|).
* By subtracting the minimum value and (if necessary) applying an order-preserving bijection from (g(V(G))) to a subset of ({0,\dots,q}), we can obtain a graceful labeling in the standard sense (possibly after reindexing the (d_k) in a monotone way). Since only differences matter, this normalization does not affect the edge-label set.

Thus, **assuming Lemma 6.1 and Lemma 7.1**, we obtain a graceful labeling of (G) from the graceful labeling of (L(G)), proving the main conjecture.

---

## 8. Where the attempt fails

So far everything is logically consistent **conditional on** Lemmas 6.1 and 7.1. The problem is that these two lemmas are highly nontrivial, and at present we have no proof of either. Let me spell out the obstacles:

1. **Cycle Consistency Lemma (6.1).**

   * The lemma asserts that the existence of a graceful labeling of (L(G)) imposes a strong linear congruence-like structure on the **ordered edge set** of (G).
   * But the combinatorics of cycles in (G) is complicated, and there is no clear mechanism that forces (\sum \sigma_k d_k = 0) around every cycle.
   * While one might hope to use information from the edge labels of (L(G)) (differences of (f)-values) to construct such signs, this has to be done globally and coherently across all cycles, a requirement analogous to solving a large system of linear equations over (\mathbb{Z}) with highly structured coefficients. There is no known general theorem ensuring this solvability.

2. **Injectivity Lemma (7.1).**

   * Even if cycle constraints can be satisfied, nothing obvious prevents two vertices from ending up with the same label when we construct (g) from path sums.
   * Preventing collisions in (g) amounts to a delicate combinatorial balancing problem: the paths between vertices must differ in net signed sums of distinct integers ({1,\dots,q}) in a collision-free way.
   * Again, it is not clear how the gracefulness of (L(G)) alone can enforce such a strong property on (g).

In other words, the **main attempt reduces the conjecture to two nontrivial arithmetical/combinatorial conditions** on the edge set of (G) that we do not know how to derive from the structure of a graceful line graph.

---

## 9. Summary

* We restated the conjecture and formalized what it means to “pull back” a graceful labeling from (L(G)) to (G).
* We set up a general framework (Problem A) in which a vertex labeling (g) is determined by choosing distinct edge-differences (d_k) and signs (\sigma_k) satisfying cycle constraints.
* We proposed a natural choice of (d_k) based on ordering edges by their graceful labels (f(e_k)) in (L(G)).
* To complete the proof, we formulated two key lemmas:

  * **Lemma 6.1** (Cycle Consistency Lemma): there exist signs (\sigma_k) making all cycle sums zero.
  * **Lemma 7.1** (Injectivity Lemma): the resulting vertex labeling (g) is injective.
* The proof of the main conjecture would follow if these lemmas could be established.
* However, **we currently lack proofs of Lemma 6.1 and Lemma 7.1**; they encapsulate the deep difficulty of the problem. Thus the above is a structured *attempt*, not a complete proof.

---

If you’d like, the next step could be:

* to **analyze special cases** (e.g., trees or unicyclic graphs) where Lemma 6.1 might be provable, or
* to **stress-test this approach** by trying to verify Lemma 6.1 explicitly on small graphs using concrete graceful labelings of their line graphs.
