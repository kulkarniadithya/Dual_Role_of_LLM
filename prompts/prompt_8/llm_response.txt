I’ll treat the statement in its **literal global form**:

> > **Claim (Global Form).** For every finite simple graph (G), if (G) is nongraceful, then its line graph (L(G)) is graceful.

and give a clean, journal-style **disproof** by explicit counterexample.
(As we’ll note at the end, *restricted* versions of this implication may still be open and interesting.)

## 1. Preliminaries

Throughout, all graphs are finite, simple, and undirected.

### Definition 1.1 (Graceful labeling and graceful graph)

Let (G = (V,E)) be a graph with (|E| = q).
A **graceful labeling** of (G) is an injective map
[
f : V(G) \to {0,1,\dots,q}
]
such that the multiset of induced edge labels
[
{|f(u)-f(v)| : uv \in E(G)}
]
consists of pairwise distinct integers and is exactly the set ({1,2,\dots,q}).

If (G) admits a graceful labeling, we say that (G) is **graceful**.
If no such labeling exists, we say that (G) is **nongraceful**.

---

### Definition 1.2 (Line graph)

Given a graph (G = (V,E)), its **line graph** (L(G)) is defined by:

* (V(L(G)) = E(G)), i.e. each vertex of (L(G)) represents an edge of (G);
* Two vertices (e_1, e_2 \in V(L(G))) are adjacent in (L(G)) if and only if the corresponding edges (e_1, e_2 \in E(G)) share a common endpoint in (G).

---

### Definition 1.3 (Cycle)

For an integer (n \ge 3), the **cycle** (C_n) is the graph on vertices
[
V(C_n) = {v_0, v_1, \dots, v_{n-1}}
]
with edges
[
E(C_n) = {v_i v_{i+1} : i = 0,1,\dots,n-1},
]
where indices are taken modulo (n) (so (v_{n} = v_0)).

---

## 2. The line graph of a cycle

We first identify the structure of the line graph of a cycle.

### Lemma 2.1

For every integer (n \ge 3),
[
L(C_n) \cong C_n.
]

#### Proof

Let (C_n) be as in Definition 1.3, with vertices ({v_0,\dots,v_{n-1}}) and edges
[
e_i := v_i v_{i+1} \quad (i=0,1,\dots,n-1),
]
indices taken modulo (n). Then
[
E(C_n) = {e_0, e_1, \dots, e_{n-1}}.
]

In the line graph (L(C_n)), the vertices are ({e_0,\dots,e_{n-1}}).
Two vertices (e_i) and (e_j) in (L(C_n)) are adjacent if and only if the corresponding edges (e_i, e_j) share a common endpoint in (C_n).

Fix (i). The edge (e_i = v_i v_{i+1}) in (C_n) meets exactly two other edges:

* (e_{i-1} = v_{i-1} v_i) (common endpoint (v_i)), and
* (e_{i+1} = v_{i+1} v_{i+2}) (common endpoint (v_{i+1})),

with indices modulo (n). No other edge of (C_n) shares a vertex with (e_i).

Hence, in (L(C_n)), each vertex (e_i) is adjacent **precisely** to (e_{i-1}) and (e_{i+1}). Therefore:

* every vertex in (L(C_n)) has degree (2);
* the adjacency pattern is exactly that of a cycle of length (n).

Define a map
[
\varphi : V(L(C_n)) \to V(C_n), \qquad \varphi(e_i) := v_i.
]
Then (e_i e_{i+1}) is an edge of (L(C_n)) if and only if (e_i) and (e_{i+1}) are incident edges in (C_n), which holds if and only if (v_i v_{i+1}) is an edge of (C_n). Thus the adjacency is preserved and (\varphi) is a graph isomorphism. Therefore,
[
L(C_n) \cong C_n.
]
(\Box)

## 3. A classical result on cycles and graceful labelings

We now recall a standard theorem in the theory of graceful labelings.

### Lemma 3.1 (Gracefulness of cycles)

Let (n \ge 3). Then the cycle (C_n) is graceful **if and only if**
[
n \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \quad \text{or} \quad n \equiv 3 \pmod{4}.
]

In particular, if
[
n \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \quad \text{or} \quad n \equiv 2 \pmod{4},
]
then (C_n) is **nongraceful**.

#### Proof sketch / reference

This characterization is a classical result, originally obtained by A. Rosa and subsequently recorded in standard references. For a detailed proof, see for example:

* J. A. Gallian, *A Dynamic Survey of Graph Labeling* (Electronic Journal of Combinatorics, Dynamic Survey), in the section on graceful cycles.

In the context of this paper, we treat Lemma 3.1 as a known theorem and do not reproduce its proof.
(\Box)

## 4. Disproof of the global implication

We now disprove the global implication

[
(\forall G); [ G \text{ is nongraceful } \Rightarrow L(G) \text{ is graceful} ].
]

### Theorem 4.1

In the class of all finite simple graphs, the implication
[
G \text{ nongraceful } \Longrightarrow L(G) \text{ graceful}
]
is false. More precisely, for each integer (n \ge 3) with (n \equiv 1 \pmod{4}) or (n \equiv 2 \pmod{4}), the cycle (C_n) is a graph such that **both** (C_n) and (L(C_n)) are nongraceful.

#### Proof

Let (n) be an integer with (n \ge 3) and
[
n \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \quad \text{or} \quad n \equiv 2 \pmod{4}.
]

Consider the graph (G = C_n).

1. **(G) is nongraceful.**
   By Lemma 3.1, the cycle (C_n) is graceful if and only if (n \equiv 0) or (3 \pmod{4}).
   Our choice of (n) (congruent to (1) or (2) modulo (4)) implies that (C_n) is **not** graceful. Hence (G) is nongraceful.

2. **Compute the line graph (L(G)).**
   By Lemma 2.1, we have
   [
   L(C_n) \cong C_n.
   ]
   Hence,
   [
   L(G) \cong C_n.
   ]

3. **(L(G)) is also nongraceful.**
   Since (L(G)) is isomorphic to (C_n) and (n \equiv 1) or (2 \pmod{4}), Lemma 3.1 again implies that (C_n) is nongraceful.
   Thus (L(G)) is nongraceful.

Therefore, for such an (n), the graph (G = C_n) satisfies:

* (G) is nongraceful, and
* (L(G)) is nongraceful.

This furnishes a counterexample to the universal implication
[
G \text{ nongraceful } \Rightarrow L(G) \text{ graceful}.
]

Consequently, the global version of the conjecture is false.
(\Box)

## 5. Remarks on scope and possible restricted versions

The theorem above rigorously shows that the implication

[
(\forall \text{ finite simple } G); [ G \text{ nongraceful } \Rightarrow L(G) \text{ graceful}]
]

**fails** when interpreted over **all** finite simple graphs, because cycles (C_n) with (n \equiv 1,2 \pmod{4}) are explicit counterexamples.

However, this does **not** address more refined statements, such as:

* the same implication restricted to **trees**,
* or to **unicyclic graphs** other than the cycles (C_n) with (n \equiv 1,2 \pmod{4}),
* or to other specific graph classes.

Those restricted versions may very well still be open and are natural directions for further research.

---

So, in summary:

* The **global** conjecture “if (G) is nongraceful then (L(G)) is graceful” is definitively **false**, and the above proof is fully rigorous and self-contained modulo a standard, properly cited lemma on cycles.
* The genuinely interesting and potentially unsolved part now lies in **identifying classes of graphs** for which some version of that implication *does* hold.
